# Distributions of Edit-Session Lengths
<h3>(by platform; for visual-editor powered interfaces)</h3>

The purpose of this analysis is to help the Editing team understand the distribution of edit session lengths for visual-editor-powered editing interfaces, across platforms. The findings are intended to help the editing team inform their decision for how long should the edit stash [TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) be set to ([T320536](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T320536)).

The learning objectives are to understand the distributions of edit sessions lengths (by platform):
- for edits that were initiated and successfully saved
- for edits that were initiated and aborted
